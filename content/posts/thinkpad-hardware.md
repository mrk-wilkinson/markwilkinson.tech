**Upgrades/Modifications**

SSD install into the existing and empty WWAN (Cellular modem) slot

1. First we have to take out the external battery.  Its secured by two slide locks.
2. Next, we have to unscrew the captive screws from the backplate
3. After you can shim the back cover off.  There are clips so go slowly around and pop them up.
4. With the back cover off, we can unplug the cable to the internal battery.  I don't find it necessary to take it fully out
5. After inserting the SSD into the modem slot (it only fits one way, atleast for this ssd) you can push it down and insert the screw to hold it in
6. Reconnect the battery cable
7. Clip the back cover back on
8. Screw back in the captive screws
9. Put back in the external battery


**Result**

Now I have a laptop that has been reunited with a storage medium.  OS install and setup are in the next posts.
